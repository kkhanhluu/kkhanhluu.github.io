This articles will discuss some key takeaways to know about ‚Äúcloud-native‚Äù term, why does it matter and how is it different from ‚Äúmicroservices architecture‚Äù.</p>\n<h2>Today‚Äôs application requirements</h2>\n<p>The ubiquity of internet has pushed the boundaries of user‚Äôs expectation to the application that they use daily. Here are some key requirements for any popular applications:</p>\n<h3>Zero downtime</h3>\n<p>Gone are the days when even short maintenance windows during which applications are unavailable are tolerated. Nowadays, applications are expected to be available 24/7 without any downtime.</p>\n<h3>Frequent software releases</h3>\n<p>Users are excited for whizzbang new features. Developers want to release a feature as soon as possible and get a quick feedback. In order to do release software more frequently, we need an architecture that enables agility and helps us to build the software more robustly.</p>\n<h3>Great number of connected devices</h3>\n<p>Gone are the days that we only have PC and laptop connected to internet. Nowadays, apart from PC and laptop, an application must be support at least two mobile device platforms, iOS and Android, desktop app, tablet,‚Ä¶ In some cases, sensors and devices such as cameras, thermostats,‚Ä¶ must also be supported. That means two requirements. First, the number of requests sent to the system increase so the system must adapt to expanding demands. Second, the volume of data flowing over internet has significantly increased.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics of a modern application</h2>\n<p>In order to fulfill all above mentioned requirements, a modern application need to have following characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Redundancy:</em></strong> In order to ensure the system to be up 24/7, we need to have a system with redundant nodes to compensate for inevitable failures.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Modularity:</em></strong> The goal here is to release code frequenetly. A monolith application with many closely interrelated modules doesn‚Äôt allow this. In recent time, it‚Äôs been proven that software made up of smaller, loosely coupled and indepently deployable components enables more flexible release model. This architecture is often called <strong>microservices.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic scalability:</strong> As a result of tidal waves of requests and data volumes, the software is required to be scaled dynamically. The resources need to be scaled up in rush hours and scaled down in other circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The picture below was taken from the book ‚ÄúCloud native patterns‚Äù, depicts the core characteristics of a cloud-native software based on its requirements</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/78c160bf36798390bf26702cba5eca3f/34e70/characteristics.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAKCAYAAAC0VX7mAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAA80lEQVQoz22S1wqFQAxE9/8/UvDJ3rBgz+UEInGvgYCbOpkxXNcl27bJcRyC3fetjk3TJF3XyTAM0ve9nOepcXratpW6rqWqKnXy1AeSJMZx/BvIEuIUspRaq2FRURRSlqVkWSbrump9oGBZFonNDzX0Pm627/uzCHsGWqEhtDcNuB/m8yADvcV1oAXiJhvoG+KFDLSFipAEpJL4QgiH8PVlXAZ/aIBIiBbgB3KbpnlxYcNRGOebPG68AmKeZ73ARAu+2TfYqXz7Ifb2ir9E8QGQpGkqSZLoCX5JrK5xn+e5/jrQAogQKwoCuIjP/+LXI7eTfx3iEe/d1+/WAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Untitled\"\n        title=\"Untitled\"\n        src=\"/static/78c160bf36798390bf26702cba5eca3f/f058b/characteristics.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/78c160bf36798390bf26702cba5eca3f/c26ae/characteristics.png 158w,\n/static/78c160bf36798390bf26702cba5eca3f/6bdcf/characteristics.png 315w,\n/static/78c160bf36798390bf26702cba5eca3f/f058b/characteristics.png 630w,\n/static/78c160bf36798390bf26702cba5eca3f/40601/characteristics.png 945w,\n/static/78c160bf36798390bf26702cba5eca3f/34e70/characteristics.png 1053w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Definition of cloud-native</h2>\n<p>All those requirements, characteristics along with the availability of new platform on which you can run the software, lead to a new architectural style for software: <strong>cloud-navtive</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Cloud-native software is highly distributed, must operate in a constantly changing environment, and is itself constantly changing.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Cloud vs cloud-native</h2>\n<p>Let‚Äôs take a closer look at ‚Äúcloud-native‚Äù definition. The software must operate in a constantly changing environment and <code class=\"language-text\">cloud</code> is a constantly changing environment. When you have a ‚Äúcloud-native‚Äù software, your software will run well in <code class=\"language-text\">cloud</code>. You might say that this software feels quite at home in the cloud. It‚Äôs native of that land.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">Cloud</code> is about <em>where</em> we‚Äôre computing. <code class=\"language-text\">Cloud-native</code> is about <em>how</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Cloud vs microservices</h2>\n<p>One of the requirements for cloud-native software is the modularity. Microservices architecture allows for the creation of modular, independently deployable components by breaking a monolithic application into smaller components. Therefore, cloud native and microservices are very related concepts. They should go hand-in-hand, but it is possible to have a microservices-based application that is not cloud native</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n<p>The key requirements for modern applications call for enabling rapid iteration and frequent releases, zero downtime, and a massive increase in the volume and variety of the devices connected to it. Cloud-native applications can remain stable, even when the infrastructure they‚Äôre running on is constantly changing or even experiencing difficulties. <em>Cloud</em> is about where software runs and <em>cloud-native</em> is about how it runs.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"üå•Ô∏è What is cloud native","date":"March 25, 2023","description":"What is cloud native","time":"10"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/loose-equality-vs-strict-equality/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"üìö Javascript foundation: Loose Equality vs Strict Equality "}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/event-sourcing-vs-event-driven-architecture/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"üì© Event sourcing vs Event Driven architecture"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5878083b-155b-5511-a4a9-82e4cabfc858","previousPostId":"e319fff6-f446-58ad-87bc-bee470af1cfc","nextPostId":"d249dd6f-31c4-5ea4-a015-7423df0b2068"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1642819152"]}
